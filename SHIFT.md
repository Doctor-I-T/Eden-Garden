THE BIG SHIFT IN HEALTH

overview:
SHIFT is a health system which doesn't requires any intermediary or health institution
and it using a distributed infrastructure so every exchange occurs on the the network edge

it is like a uber of health or more where the system pairs patients with practitioners such that the service can be delivered personalized. 

We are the [[health-shifters]] and we are promoting a new kind of health which is from a place
of love, of care, of truth, and harmony.

Our approach to healing is
- trully inlined with individual soul purpose
- people to people (P2P)
- in resonance with the "intelligent" universe
  
  
 we open now for partners applications, to structure our system deployment all talents are welcomed.
